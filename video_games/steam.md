# Steam Tips

## Play Lego Multiplayer with Remote Play Together

Only one person needs to own the game! That person (the host) will launch the game, then open the Steam overlay feature (typically using Shift + Tab). In the Steam overlay, select your friend from your friends list and click "Remote Play Together". Once your friend accepts the invite, they will be added to the game as if it was local multiplayer and the game will be streamed to them.

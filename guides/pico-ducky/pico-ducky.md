# USB Rubber Ducky with a Raspberry Pi Pico

These instructions are based on a Network Chuck [video](https://youtu.be/e_f9p-_JWZw?si=-Pi4_0Et5AeEkKTN) and the [pico-ducky](https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) Github repo.

After following the instructions from the pico-ducky repository, I was able to start playing with some duckscript on my Linux machine to do some keystroke injection. It started with a simple [hello world in the terminal](./hello_world.dd)

Next up is a good ole' rick roll...

# Example Programs

Do you ever do something really simple in a program that you end up using again and again but have trouble remembering exactly how you did it? I do that a lot. Especially if it is something that is sparsely used or used in bursts, forgotten, then needed again. I've begun compiling some of the basic programs as "examples" not only for myself but if someone says "Hey, that's cool!" or "How did you do that?". Now I can just send them a basic example!

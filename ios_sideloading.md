# Sideload iOS Apps

Sideloading onto iOS devices allows for apps that aren’t available on the app store or even versions that aren’t available for download anymore. For newer iOS devices, one can use AltStore but for older iOS devices, such as an iPad Mini 1, [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) can be used. iTunes must also be installed and signed into. ipa files store iOS apps. 

## Instructions for a basic sideload are listed below for Windows.
- Make sure [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) is downloaded & installed
- Sign into iTunes
- Download and install Sideloadly
- Download your ipa of choice
- Make sure your iOS device is plugged in
- On Sideloadly, select your device, select the IPA to use from your file system, and enter your throw away iCloud account. When you hit start for the first time, it will request your password. It will probably be saved after that.
- If the app is installed but gives a message about the developer, go into settings, general, device management. Then trust the developer.
- If the install is failing at 40% due to “Failed to verify code signature” then make sure the time is synced on the ipad and the computer.
- If the app opens but immediately crashes, it could either be too old as in the developer key expired or if crashing upon installation, then the app just won’t work on that device with your version of iOS.

# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive coding notebook. Notes can be taken in markdown as code is worked through in an interactive environment. Jupyter is most commonly used with Interactive Python (IPython), but many languages are supported and available.

## Self Hosting

### For a Single User

Jupyter Notebook documentation provides [instructions](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/4.x/public_server.html) on hosting a web server. 

### For Multiple Users

For some or many users, [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be set up. It will provide sessions and environments for each user so there are no collisions.

## IHaskell

[IHaskell](https://github.com/IHaskell/IHaskell) is a kernel for Jupyter allowing the use of Haskell inside the console and notebook.

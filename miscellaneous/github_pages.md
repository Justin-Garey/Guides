# GitHub Pages

GitHub pages is a free way to host a static website
from GitHub. On a free account the page will be hosted
at the location of user-name.github.io/repository-name. 
Or if it is hosted in a repository of your user-name.github.io, 
then the page will be hosted at user-name.github.io.

## Deploying a Vite React App

I have a React application created with Vite located in 
a repository named Justin-Garey.github.io, the same as my user 
name. To deploy the React application, we make use of 
GitHub actions. This [guide](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy)
from Vite was helpful in the setup process. For me, 
the only thing I really had to do after pushing my 
application to the repository was setup the action
and enable GitHub Pages in the respository settings under
"Pages".

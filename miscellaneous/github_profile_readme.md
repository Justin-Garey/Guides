# Creating and Using a GitHub Profile README

A GitHub profile README is just that: a README for your profile. 
It can be used to tell the world a bit about yourself or open up
some of your projects. 

## Skill Icons for the README

While looking at examples of other GitHub profile READMEs, I found 
many people using skill icons to show off their skills in a more 
visually appealing way. [Skill icons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons)
have icons for programming languages, tools, and applications.

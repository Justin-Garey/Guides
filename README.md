# Guides

The following guides are of things I have done and encountered. During the process I either thought that this would be useful for someone else or thought that it would be useful for myself in the future. If you do stumble upon this and try to use something from one of the guides and it doesn't work, go ahead and let me know by opening an issue. I'm not checking anything on here until I actually use it again. Some things may also be much more detailed than others just due to the amount of time I've put into it. 

## Tools
- Tips for better use of [SSH](./tools/ssh.md).
- Helpful [Git](./tools/git.md) Tips can be found here.
- [Testing Memory](./tools/memtester.md) (RAM).
-  Install Node and npm with the [Node Version Manager](./tools/install_node_ubuntu.md) (nvm).
-  [Python Virtual Environments](./tools/python_venv.md) are good to know how to use.

## Linux Management

- Perform [User Modifications](./linux_management/linux_user_mods.md) such as changing the username and home directory.

## Scripts
- This [category](./scripts/scripts.md) is a reference to one way I manage useful scripts I create and how to access them easily. This is helpful for having global access to scripts I use.

## Self Hosting
- Stream with [Stremio](./self_hosting/stremio.md)

## Projects
- How to use a Selenium like library in Rust. A [Thirtyfour](./projects/thirtyfour.md) tutorial is provided that will fetch the Merriam Webster word of the day.

## Miscellaneous
- [Screensaver instructions](./miscellaneous/screensaver.md) for general use and specifically my Raspberry Pi mounted on the wall with a screen.

## Future Guides & Topics
- Jellyfin is the opensource version of Plex. I really want a plex like server to store my movies and tv shows for kodi to grab from and for the web interface so I could just vpn into home and watch movies from afar.
- The Pwnagatchi is a really cool little hacking device but I needed to get some cables to get it set up. Once I have time to work on this more, the guide and supporting files will be added. I'm really excited for this because I want to learn more about how Wi-Fi works and this is perfectly hands on.
- How to add a user in linux and adding that user to groups. This would be a modification to the [user modifications](./linux_management/linux_user_mods.md) file.
- Home Assistant is another application I will setup and once I do a guide will follow along with it.
- A guide on Obsidian.md is on its way. I just started using it and want to add some plugins before I get into a guide for it.
- Zotero is a great tool for tracking papers, documents, articles, books, etc..

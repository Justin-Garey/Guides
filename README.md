# Guides

The following guides are of things I have done and encountered. During the process I either thought that this would be useful for someone else or thought that it would be useful for myself in the future. If you do stumble upon this and try to use something from one of the guides and it doesn't work, go ahead and let me know by opening an issue. I'm not checking anything on here until I actually use it again. Some things may also be much more detailed than others just due to the amount of time I've put into it. 

## Tools
- Tips for better use of [SSH](./tools/ssh.md).
- Helpful [Git](./tools/git.md) Tips can be found here.
- [Testing Memory](./tools/memtester.md) (RAM).
-  Install Node and npm with the [Node Version Manager](./tools/install_node_ubuntu.md) (nvm).
-  [Python Virtual Environments](./tools/python_venv.md) are good to know how to use.

## Linux Management
- Remove the [Boot Logo](./linux_management/rm_boot_logo.md) on Ubuntu.

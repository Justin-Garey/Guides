# VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a code editor with a good amount of features and great community support through the use of extensions. I use it because it is what I am most comfortable with and it has more than enough to handle all of my needs.

I primarily use it for the ease of access for files in a code base (the file explorer bar) and the text editor. I also use the remote window feature to use VS Code on another machine over ssh.

I'm fairly basic when it comes to extensions. I typically just install the recommended extensions for what I'm working working on like Python support when a Python file is opened. I do have some extensions that are more for fun and some that I consider must haves when I am working. Extensions are cool and can be great but aren't necessary. I stick to language specific extensions by verified distributors mainly for the syntax highlighting and autocomplete features.

## Must Have Extensions
- Prettier - Code formatter by Prettier
	- Intended for front end and JavaScript development.
	- A consistent code style is enforced through prettier.
- Code Spell Checker by Street Side Software
	- Works like an integrated linter, highlighting words that are unknown or misspelled.

## For Fun Extensions
- vscode-pets by Anthony Shaw
	- Allows you to have some pets that can be interacted with alongside the editor.

# RTL-SDR

An RTL-SDR is a cheap USB dongle (~$30) that can be used for receiving radio signals. Depending on the model, it could be used to receive frequencies from 500 kHz to 1.75 GHz. The RTL-SDR stems from the mass produced DVB-T TV tuner dongles based on the RTL28324 chipset. Raw I/Q data is accessible from the chipset.

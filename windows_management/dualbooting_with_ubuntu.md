# Dual Booting Windows with Ubuntu

## How To:

This was actually much easier than I thought it would be since I used two SSDs. I started with Windows by putting one SSD into the computer then booting and installing Windows on that. Once that was done, I removed that SSD and put the second SSD in. Then I was able to boot and install Ubuntu on the second SSD. Lastly, I put the Windows SSD back in and set that as the priority boot in the BIOS menu. To switch to Linux, I have to restart the computer and enter the BIOS menu to select the Ubuntu boot option. The computer is fast enough that this has not yet become annoying. 

## Problems

There don't seem to be any major problems as of yet between Ubuntu and Windows. Whatever I have and do encounter is listed here:
